**TL:DR**: We systematically benchmark audio events relation in Text-to-Audio generation by proposing:
 1. audio events relation corpus 
 2. audio event category corpus 
 3. seed audio event corpus 
 4. new audio events relation aware evaluation metrics 
 5. finetuning strategy for existing TTA models to boost their audio events relation modelling capability.

**RiTTA Motivation**: The acoustic world is rich with diverse audio events that exhibit various relationships. While text can precisely describe these relationships, current TTA models struggle to capture both the audio events and the relations conveyed by the text. This challenge motivates us to systematically study RiTTA.

### Audio Events Relation Corpus

We construct four main relations, each of which contains multiple sub-relations. In total, we have constructed 11 relations.

| Main Relation      | Sub-Relation                | Sample Text Prompt                                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Temporal Order     | before; after; simultaneity  | generate dog barking audio, followed by cat meowing                        |
| Spatial Distance   | close first; far first; equal dist. | generate dog barking audio that is 1 meter away, followed by another 5 meters away |
| Count              | count                        | produce 3 audios: dog barking, cat meowing and talking                     |
| Compositionality   | and; or; not; if-then-else   | create dog barking audio or cat meowing audio                              |

### Audio Events Category Corpus

We construct four main audio events categories that cover the commonly heard audio events in our daily life, each of which further corresponds to multiple sub-categories. For each category, we collect five seed exemplar audios from either [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) or VCTK dataset [1] (just for the talking category). 

| Main Category              | Sub-Category                                                                 |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Human Audio                | baby crying; talking; laughing; coughing; whistling                          |
| Animal Audio               | cat meowing; bird chirping; dog barking; rooster crowing; sheep bleating      |
| Machinery                  | boat horn; car horn; door bell; paper shredder; telephone ring               |
| Human-Object Interaction   | vegetable chopping; door slam; footstep; keyboard typing; toilet flush        |
| Object-Object Interaction  | emergent brake; glass drop; hammer nailing; key jingling; wood sawing        |

### Text-Audio Pair Generation Strategy

We maximise the text-audio pair generation diversity by:

1. adopting GPT-4 to augment the text description so that the same relation can be expressed by multiple vibrant texts.
2. disentangling relation text description and audio events so that the same relation can be associated with arbitrary audio events.
3. diversifying the final audio generation from selected audio events.

### Relation Aware Evaluation

For any TTA model generated audio, we first apply audio events detection model (in our case, we use PANNS [2]) to detect all potential audio events. Each detected audio event has the meta data: start/end time, semantic class, confidence score. Based on the detected audio events, we adopt a multi-stage relation aware evaluation framework to evaluate how accurate the pre-specified relation is incorporated in the audio.

* **Presence Score**, which checks whether the pre-specified audio events are detected in the generated audio.
* **Relation Correctness Score**, which further checks if the pre-specified relation is correctly modelled in the generated audio.
* **Parsimony Score**, which checks the redundancy in the generated audio, unnecessary and excessive audio events lead to lower parsimony score.

Finally, averaging across all relations gets average-(Presence/Relation Correctness/Parsimony) score, further averaging across multiple audio events confidence scores gets mean average (mA-) Presence/Relation Correctness/Parsimony score. Multiplying the three mA- scores gives us the final multi-stage relation aware score **mAMSR**.

### Tango Fintuning Result

We finetune Tango [3] with 44 hours our generated text-audio relation data. The quantitative evaluation shows finetuning can improve existing TTA model's audio events relation modelling capability.

| Model                        | FAD $\downarrow$  | KL $\downarrow$   | FD $\downarrow$   | mAPre $\uparrow$ | mARel $\uparrow$   | mAPar $\uparrow$   | mAMSR $\uparrow$   |

| Tango (finetuning)            | **4.60** | **23.92** | **27.03** | **21.23** | **10.78** | **20.35** | **48.67** |
